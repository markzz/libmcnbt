markzz's Minecraft NBT C Library
================================

This is a library that opens, examines, modifies, and saves NBT data for the
game Minecraft. This document discusses the basics of the library.

There are two files that should be distributed with this library, the library
itself and "mcnbt.h". Only data, structures, and functions declared in the
latter file are available to any linking software and the structures are opaque
and its elements are to be accessed only through the provided functions.

Generally, functions are named in the format "nbt_<type>_<action>" (example
nbt_tree_get_name). Internal functions are given a prepended underscore (_).
